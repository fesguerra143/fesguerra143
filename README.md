# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/feesguerra/">About Me & My Portfolio </a>  🛡️🔒💻

An IT and Security Professional, I bring a diverse 20-year background spanning networking, cybersecurity, web, and cloud technologies. My expertise is solidified by certifications like Microsoft Azure (AZ-900, AZ-104, AZ-500, SC-900), CompTIA Security+, and ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC). I also excel in web development, business application implementation (ERP, CRM, CMS), and project management.

My passion for cybersecurity is matched by my drive to solve complex problems through practical projects. I actively engage in vulnerability management, threat detection, and other initiatives that deepen my understanding of the evolving security landscape. Please take a moment to review my projects to see how I contribute to strengthening security operations.
